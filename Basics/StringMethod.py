# String Methods Demonstration

name = "garrett"

print(len(name)) # length in characters of the variable
print(name.find("a")) # finds where a character is in the array of the variable.
print(name.capitalize()) # Upper case first character
print(name.upper()) # Upper case the entire variable
print(name.lower()) # All lower case
print(name.isdigit()) # Is a digit? Boolean response
print(name.isalpha()) # Are all chatacters in alphabet? Boolean response
print(name.count("r")) # Counts the occurences of the letter r in name
print(name.replace("r","b")) # replaces all r's with b's in name
print(name*3) # not a method, but prints name 3 times
print(name.replace("r","b")*3) # quiz time, what does this do?
