Explanation:

Import the requests library: This library allows you to make HTTP requests to the API.

Define your API key and base URL: You need to sign up on the OpenWeatherMap website to get your API key and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual key.

Get the city name from the user: This allows the user to input the city for which they want to fetch weather information.

Construct request parameters: We create a dictionary params to specify the parameters for the API request. In this example, we provide the city name, your API key, and request the temperature in metric units.

Send an HTTP GET request: We use the requests.get() method to send a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the specified parameters.

Check the response: We check if the HTTP response code is 200 (OK), indicating a successful request.

Extract and display weather information: If the response is successful, we extract and print the temperature and weather description from the JSON response.

Remember to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key, and you can explore the OpenWeatherMap API documentation for more details on available features and parameters: https://openweathermap.org/api.
